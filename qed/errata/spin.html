<h1 class=title>Spin Torque and Zeta Force of Dimer of Alkali Atoms </h1>

In our code, there is a bug. 
We have rivised our figures,
but the statements are almost the same.
These figures are computed with the basis sets, aug-cc-pCVQZ.

<br>
<img src="./spin/fig1.jpg" width=80%><br>
Figs. 2(d) and 3(d) are revised by the left and right panel, respectively.
<br>
<br>


<img src="./spin/fig2.jpg" width=80%><br>
Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) are revised by the left and right panel, respectively.
<br>
<br>

<img src="./spin/fig3.jpg" width=80%><br>
Instead of figs. 4(a) and 4(b) (D=2.8 angstrom),
we show the result for D=3.0 angstrom.
The spin torque and zeta force are the left and right panel, respectively.

Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) are revised by the left and right panel, respectively.
