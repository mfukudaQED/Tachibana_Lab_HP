<li>Formalization of the non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on 
Onsagar's local equilibrium hypothesis with considering 
quantum-mechanical interaction through the interface between separated 
regions </li>
<li>Formalization of the relationship among the regional electric 
chemical potentials in the chemical equilibrium system by defining the 
regional electron numbers, the regional electronic energies, and new 
properties about quantum mechanical interference effect between 
separated regions ("the quantum mechanical law of mass action") </li>
<li>The regional chemical potentials are not necessary equal to each 
other, to the Fermi level of standing wave on the whole system, nor to 
the chemical potential of the whole system even in the chemical 
equilibrium system. ("the regional chemical potential inequality 
principle") </li>
</ul>
<p><br> <br><strong>【New Images of Chemical Interaction by QED (Quantum Electrodynamics)】</strong></p>
<p>Generally, the relativistic theory has been considered as only a 
slight correction for the interpretation in chemical phenomena. However,
 we have first clarified that the Hamiltonian of the quantum 
electrodynamics (QED), derived from the picture of "action through 
medium" based on the relativistic theory, gives a novel image of the 
chemical interaction even in the non-relativistic limit.</p>
<p>As a result, though the energy as an integrating value of the 
Hamiltonian of QED with respect to the whole space is equivalent to that
 of a usual ab initio Hamiltonian, conventional images of the chemical 
interaction based on "action at a distance" are replaced with the new 
images of them given by the picture of "action through medium" without 
exception.</p>

<h3 align="left">Simulation of the Electromigration</h3>
<p align="left">It is indispensable to predict properties of electronics
 devices for the design of device materials with high performance. 
Recently, first-principle calculations have been recognized as an 
important tool of investigating structures and properties of devices, 
and the electronic states affected by the external electric field and 
current will be needed for the advanced discussion because the devices 
are practically caused by the electric field and current.</p>
<p align="left">Our laboratory has been developing and improving program
 codes for the first-principle calculation with the external electric 
field and current. We clarify the electronic structures of crystals, 
surfaces, and interfaces of devices under the practical condition in 
terms of the quantum energy density based on the regional density 
functional theory with our program codes and give a theoretical guide to
 quantum design, quantum control, and reliability of novel devices.</p>
<p align="left">The electromigration is a phenomenon of moving atoms on 
surface or in bulk by a strong electric current. We have carried out the
 simulation of the electromigration by use of wave packets representing 
mobile atoms and have discussed the local electronic stresses and the 
charge density distribution by defining new properties such as the 
effective charge tensor densities.</p>

<h3 align="left">Prediction of Electronic Properties and Reliability of Insulating Thin Films</h3>
<p align="left">Much thinner gate insulating films of transistor have 
been demanded with the advance of electronic devices in speediness and 
fineness. However, the excessive thin film of gate insulator does not 
make sure of the reliability of the device by giving rise to the 
time-dependent dielectric breakdown, and the performance of the device 
falls down according to a gain of the stress-induced leak current 
(SILC).</p>
<p align="left">For the mechanism of a defect production toward the 
dielectric breakdown, it is known that residual hydrogen atoms in the 
oxide film are concerned in the defect production. It is necessary to 
investigate a behavior of the hydrogen atoms for the development of a 
gate insulating thin film with high reliability.</p>
<p align="left">We have studied detailed mechanisms of the dielectric 
breakdown of the SiO2 thin film and crystal by analyzing effects of the 
interstitial hydrogen atoms in SiO2 on the electronic state under the 
external electric field in terms of the band structure and the quantum 
energy density. The interstitial hydrogen atoms bring about a serious 
change in the band structure, and it is proved that they are one of 
primary causes of the dielectric breakdown. The dynamics of the 
interstitial hydrogen atoms has also been discussed.</p>
<p align="left">Furthermore, we have investigated the nitridation 
mechanism for the gate insulating thin film, where the nitridation 
process is a key issue of the improvement in reliability of the gate 
insulating thin film.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="./fig/image_4.jpg" class="image-inline" height="223" width="402"></p>
<p align="center">Figure 5 Model of SiO2 thin film with the interstitial H atom and band structures of SiO2 thin film models.</p>
<h3 align="left">Prediction of Dielectric Properties of High-k Crystals and Thin Films</h3>
<p align="left">The development of new generation materials in place of 
SiO2 for the gate insulating thin film has been needed urgently because a
 thickness of the SiO2 thin film has reached a minimum as a physical 
limit. The metal oxides with a high dielectric constant (high-k metal 
oxides) have received much attention as hopeful materials which can 
raise the performance of transistor without increasing a gate leak 
current. Many experimental studies on practical use of the high-k gate 
insulating thin films are doing in both academic and industrial fields 
of research.</p>
<p align="left">For the development of new devices with high 
performance, it is essential to estimate the properties of the device 
crystals and thin films theoretically in advance. In particular, it is 
very important to estimate the dielectric properties theoretically for 
the development of high-k materials since the dielectric properties due 
to the theoretical computation give a precise guide to the design of new
 gate devices.</p>
<p align="left">We have studied the dielectric properties for the high-k
 materials such as ZrO2, HfO2, their silicate compounds, and lanthanide 
oxides (Gd2O3 etc.) by the theoretical approaches based on the 
first-principle electronic-state calculation. It has been clarified 
chemical bonding, polarization, and microscopic images of the electronic
 stresses in the devices by the calculation of electronic states under 
the external electric field and the analysis in terms of the quantum 
energy density. The dielectric constants of crystals and thin films can 
be derived by the perturbation theory and the random phase approximation
 (RPA) with the first-principle wave functions. <br>We have applied and 
improved our theory for the dielectric properties of devices through 
information by experimental research groups.<br></p>
